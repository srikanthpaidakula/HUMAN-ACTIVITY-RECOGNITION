## ✅ Results Summary

CNN significantly outperformed all traditional models by leveraging raw sensor data and capturing complex spatial-temporal patterns. This proves CNN’s capability in learning hierarchical features from multivariate time-series data without manual feature extraction.

| Model                | Performance |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression | Moderate    |
| Decision Tree       | Good        |
| Random Forest       | Good        |
| XGBoost             | Very Good   |
| Gradient Boosting   | Very Good   |
| KNN                 | Moderate    |
| **CNN**             | **Excellent (Best)** ✅ |
