# HUMAN-ACTIVITY-RECOGNITION
This project compares CNNs to traditional models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, KNN) for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). CNNs, leveraging raw sensor data, outperform traditional methods in capturing spatial-temporal dependencies and achieving accurate recognition.
